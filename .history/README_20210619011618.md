# APPROACH(Greedy):
   - Select the transactions with highest value of fee or weight.
   - Check if the selected transaction is valid, i.e. is all its parents are already included in the block.
   - If the transaction is valid include the transaction and update fee and weight and erase it from curr set. 
   - If it is not valid go to next highest transaction.
   - For getting the highest value of fee or weight We are using a set.

### Time Complexity: O(N^2), N = Number of transactions in CSV file.
